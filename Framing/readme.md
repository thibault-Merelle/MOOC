 Impact Mapping

### Global purpose :
Creation of an course website
Users will connect to our website and will be able to find a list of MOOCs inside. 
They will be able to view the details of a course, see the comments that will be attached to it and can also add their own.

### User Profiles :

- "Viewers" not logged in will be able to read courses and comments.
 - "lambda" users will be able to add comments and rate the courses.
 -  "super-users" will be able to promote users, delete comments, and add, update and delete an existing course.
